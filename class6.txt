One thing I learned about is the object.keys() method. When looking at data in a json file you can use this method to put the keys into an array
so you can loop over them.


What's the difference between: function Person(){}, var person = Person(), and var person = new Person()?
function Person(){} is a constructor
var person = Person() stores the Person() function in a variable
var person = new Person() creates a new Person object and stores it in a variable


What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?
attributes are the qualities of an object that can be created
properties are existing characteristics of an object that can be manipulated through the DOM


What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
You would use a loop to iterate over object properties and array items, for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)


What is the event loop? 
The event loop allows you to use code asynchronously. It makes it so JS doesn't pause and wait for a function to complete, it will continue to run other
code and then come back to a function when its ready to be executed


What is the difference between call stack and task queue?
Call stacks are synchronous they execute functions in order, task queue is asynchronous it runs functions when they are able to run


What are the differences between ES6 classes and ES5 function constructors?
Some of the differences are syntax, inheritance and methods
