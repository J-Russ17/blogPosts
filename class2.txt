Today I learned about conditionals. You can compare multiple things and based on the result have your function execute different commands


The difference between == and === is the == checks for equality but isnt strict on the data type or value 
whereas the === does an equality comparison but is more strict


The value of var foo = 10 + '20 would be
1020


A terminal application is pretty self-explanitory 


Ternary operator is when you write a conditional with ? and : instead of if/else


You could make a website or app more accessible by having a volume slider, subtitles, text to speech, eye tracking execute


my favorite feature of HTML5 are the <div> tags. Love wrapping everything in them div tags


I try and structure my CSS to follow my HTML from top to bottom, generally from less specific to more specific
