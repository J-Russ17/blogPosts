One thing we learned today was .forEach() is a method that only takes callback functions as its arguments and that it is 
similar to for loops.

Can you describe the main difference between a forEach loop and a .map() loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
forEach modifies the existing array
map returns a new array
I would use forEach when I want to change an array but don't want a new one and I want use .map() when I want to make a separate array with changes.
